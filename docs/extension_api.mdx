# Extension API

This system has been designed with flexibility as well as extensibility in mind from the very get-go. On this
page, the available API usable to define tags and thus AST-nodes as well as to intercept interpretation at
runtime will be documented. Let's look at an abstract overview-diagram regarding the flow of data first:

<img className='rendered-image' style={{width: '100%'}} src={useBaseUrl('/img/overview_diagram.svg')} />

## Defining Tags

While a tag-definition may look deceptively simple at first glance, the possibilities it brings to the table
cannot be overstated.

```java
public abstract class TagDefinition {

  public final TagClosing tagClosing;
  public final TagPriority tagPriority;

  protected TagDefinition(TagClosing tagClosing, TagPriority tagPriority) {
    this.tagClosing = tagClosing;
    this.tagPriority = tagPriority;
  }

  public abstract boolean matchName(InputView tagName);

  public abstract @NotNull MarkupNode createNode(
    @NotNull InputView tagName,
    @NotNull AttributeMap attributes,
    @Nullable LinkedHashSet<LetBinding> letBindings,
    @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children
  );
}
```

The above represents the template provided in order to define a new tag, to be registered
in and used with an instance of the `TagRegistry`. Immediately within the `super`-constructor,
the tag closing-type

```java
public enum TagClosing {
  // <my-tag>Content</>
  OPEN_CLOSE,
  // <my-tag/>
  SELF_CLOSE,
  // Either or - supporting both
  INVARIANT,
}
```

is to be defined, where self-closing tags may not bear any content and thereby will always
receive a `children`-list of `null`; next up, a tag-priority

```java
public enum TagPriority {
  // v- Picked first
  HIGHEST,
  HIGH,
  // v- Baseline
  NORMAL,
  LOW,
  LOWEST,
  // ^- Picked last
}

```

will signal which definition to pick if a tag's name matched on multiple registered definitions,
allowing the user to override built-in behavior (although not necessarily recommended) to any
granularity. These already are the only properties required upfront, where name- and attribute-
matching remain completely dynamic.

## Matching Names

Due to the fact that names are not to be specified ahead of time, a tag-definition may handle
patterns of arbitrary complexity, as is the case with [Color Shorthands](./built_in/style#color-shorthands). Also, in general, tag- as well as attribute-names are case-insensitive.
Once `matchName` returned `true` for one such given name, the tag-definition becomes a candidate
within the list of possible handlers, from which the one of highest priority will prevail.

## Creating Nodes

As soon as the system completed parsing the a tag in its entirety, including attributes as
well as possibly some content, `createNode` will be invoked (with the very same name matched
upon earlier, for reference), whose responsibility it is to instantiate an AST-node,
being a derivative of a `MarkupNode`:

```java
public abstract class MarkupNode {

  public @Nullable ExpressionNode ifCondition;
  public @Nullable ExpressionNode useCondition;

  public final InputView positionProvider;

  public @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children;
  public @Nullable LinkedHashSet<LetBinding> letBindings;

  public MarkupNode(
    InputView positionProvider,
    @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children,
    @Nullable LinkedHashSet<LetBinding> letBindings
  ) {
    this.positionProvider = positionProvider;
    this.children = children;
    this.letBindings = letBindings;
  }
}
```

The base class already takes care of holding the `position`, as well as optional lists of `children` and
`letBindings` (see [Let-Bindings](./tag_syntax#let-bindings)). This immediately implies that tags may
implicitly define bindings or modify child-entries. While there are many pre-defined node-types available,
users may also always define their own, handled via [Interpreter-Interception](#interpreter-interception).

## Retrieving Attributes

The astute reader might have noticed that up until this point, no attributes have ever been defined
anywhere - and for good reason: keeping a single source of truth, paired with flexibility. The `AttributeMap`,
as passed into `createNode`, handles access in a somewhat unusual, yet beautifully simplistic manner; let's
take a look at its API first:

```java
public interface AttributeMap {

  // v- Attributes of type expression

  @NotNull ExpressionNode getMandatoryExpressionNode(String name, String... aliases);

  @Nullable ExpressionNode getOptionalExpressionNode(String name, String... aliases);

  @NotNull ExpressionList getMandatoryExpressionList(String name, String... aliases);

  @NotNull ExpressionList getOptionalExpressionList(String name, String... aliases);

  // v- Attributes of type markup

  @NotNull MarkupNode getMandatoryMarkupNode(String name, String... aliases);

  @Nullable MarkupNode getOptionalMarkupNode(String name, String... aliases);

  @NotNull MarkupList getMandatoryMarkupList(String name, String... aliases);

  @NotNull MarkupList getOptionalMarkupList(String name, String... aliases);

}
```

There are two different types of attributes - [Expressions](./expression_syntax) as well as a sub-tree of
[Markup](./tag_syntax), both bound to an identifying `name`, where a name can only ever depict one and the
same type used as an internal representation of the data associated with it. Optional attributes are not required
to be present in order for the construction of the corresponding tag to succeed, while their mandatory
counterparts certainly are, failing parsing if absent; single values (nodes) may be null if omitted, while lists
are always non-null, for convenience. When requiring an attribute as a list, this simply means that it may be
specified more than once, and could possibly be bound using the spread-operator `...`.

The above instantly implies the possibility of dynamic attributes like:
`Y exists and is mandatory if and only if X is present`, as follows:

```java
ExpressionNode xValue = attributes.getOptionalExpressionNode("x");

if (xValue != null) {
  ExpressionNode yValue = attributes.getMandatoryExpressionNode("y");
  // TODO: Handle case 2
}

else {
  // TODO: Handle case 1
}
```

After `constructNode` responded with a result, the `AttributeMap` is internally checked for any unused
attributes and, if any, will fail parsing, telling the user that they've specified unsupported (at
least in their current attribute-constellation) names. This way, a tag can access attributes of exact
types and names as desired, not having to take the burden of validation, without compromising on clarity
when it comes to user-facing error-screens.

Lists of attributes are intentionally represented as an internal wrapper, due to the fact that they may be
dynamically bound, using the spread-operator `...`, which entails that the elements may not be known at
parse-time; such a list is supposed to be stored inside the constructed node as-is, to be evaluated later
during interpretation, using the concept of [Interpreter-Interception](#interpreter-interception); they are
accessed by providing a reference to the interpreter, as follows:

```java
public interface MarkupList {

  boolean isEmpty();

  List<MarkupNode> get(Interpreter interpreter);

}
```

and

```java
public interface ExpressionList {

  boolean isEmpty();

  List<ExpressionNode> get(Interpreter interpreter);

}
```

## Interpreter Interception

Many features require interception at the time of interpretation in order to be implemented; in fact, that's
exactly how - for example - the [Rainbow-Tag](./built_in/rainbow) operates, by cancelling default processing
of the elements it targets, while emitting its own colorized members into the final output.

### Interception Lifecycle

Registering to be called for interception is again as simple as it gets: once the node as constructed by
`constructNode` implements the following interface, it will be called when it itself is encountered, as well
as for every of its children:

```java
public interface InterpreterInterceptor {

  InterceptionResult interceptInterpretation(MarkupNode node, Interpreter<?, ?> interpreter);

  void afterInterpretation(MarkupNode node, Interpreter<?, ?> interpreter);

  void onSkippedByChild(MarkupNode node, Interpreter<?, ?> interpreter, InterceptionResult priorResult);

}
```

The main point of control, `interceptInterpretation`, may result in one of the following signals:

```java
public enum InterceptionResult {
  DO_NOT_PROCESS,
  DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER,
  DO_PROCESS
}
```

When instructing the interpreter to not process the current node, it will be skipped over in its entirety -
including whichever children it may have contained. In order to only render said members partially, make use
of the provided reference to the interpreter as to emit nodes manually; in most cases, processing will only
be inhibited for terminal nodes though, which are then overridden by custom instances, emitted once again
manually, while `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER` makes for a perfect way to keep a `ThreadLocal` stack within the
AST-node itself, handling state of the feature which leverages interception.

Let's look at an example of concurrent interceptors; even though per tag and thus per node, only at most a
single interceptor may be registered at a time, there may be multiple interceptors in charge at any given
depth. Due to this naturally arising mechanism, interceptors are kept on a stack, from which they are popped
as soon as the scope of their corresponding tag ends; also, interceptors who registered first (outermost tags)
always take precedence by being invoked first. A parent may skip a child's possibility of interception, such
that it is not even called into; also, a child may skip a node which a parent did allow to process:

```component-markup
<a> <!-- begin scope A -->
  <b> <!-- begin scope B -->
    <c> <!-- begin scope C -->
      ...
    </c> <!-- end scope C -->
  </b> <!-- end scope B -->
</a> <!-- end scope A -->
```

- `l-cm: <a>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Registers interceptor `A`
- `l-cm: <b>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls interceptor `B`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Registers interceptor `B`
- `l-cm: <c>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls interceptor `B`: `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER`
  - Calls interceptor `C`: `DO_NOT_PROCESS`
  - Calls `onSkippedByChild` of `A` with `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls `onSkippedByChild` of `B` with `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER`
  - Does not register `C` (as it skipped itself)

### Interpreter Reference

With the lifecycle as described above in mind, an interceptor is now fully enabled to interpret expressions,
introduce temporary variables, interpret markup subtrees, construct platform-specific components and emit to
the output, all thanks to the provided interpreter-reference:

```java
public interface Interpreter<B, C> {

  TemporaryMemberEnvironment getEnvironment();

  @NotNull String evaluateAsString(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable String evaluateAsStringOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  long evaluateAsLong(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Long evaluateAsLongOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  double evaluateAsDouble(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Double evaluateAsDoubleOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @NotNull Number evaluateAsLongOrDouble(@Nullable ExpressionNode expressionNode);

  @Nullable Number evaluateAsLongOrDoubleOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expressionNode);

  boolean evaluateAsBoolean(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  TriState evaluateAsTriState(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Object evaluateAsPlainObject(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  boolean interpret(MarkupNode node);

  boolean interpret(MarkupNode node, @Nullable Runnable afterScopeBegin);

  OutputBuilder<B, C> getCurrentBuilder();

  ComponentConstructor<B, C> getComponentConstructor();

  int getCurrentSubtreeDepth();

}
```

### Temporary Variables

In order to introduce temporary variables, update- and remove them again, there's an environment-accessor
within the interpreter, providing a way to modify the temporary-variable-stack:

```java
public interface TemporaryMemberEnvironment extends InterpretationEnvironment {

  void beginScope();

  void endScope();

  void setScopeVariable(String name, Object value);

  InterpretationEnvironment snapshot();

}
```

When introducing variable-values which are modified by reference later on, as is the case with the `loop`-variable
which the intrinsic `*for` attribute introduces, they should implement the following interface, as to allow the
system to create a static copy to be used when snapshotting the environment for captures.

```java
public interface InternalCopyable {

  Object copy();

}
```

In order to avoid having to make use of reflection whenever accessing members of objects within expressions
with the member-operator, the following interface - if implemented on the object accessed into - is called first, as to directly access
named fields; it also doubles as a means to define arbitrarily complex "getters".

```java
public interface DirectFieldAccess {

  Object UNKNOWN_FIELD_SENTINEL = new Object();

  @Nullable Object accessField(String rawIdentifier);

  @Nullable Set<String> getAvailableFields();

}
```

### Creating/Modifying Components

Components, as created by invoking the `OutputBuilder` with AST-nodes, may be modified to any degree using the
platform-specific `ComponentConstructor`; next to modifying existing components, custom components may also be
constructed from the ground up using nothing but their parameters, to be emitted directly later on. Learn more
about this class over at the [Component Constructor](./component_constructor).

### Emitting To Output

When it comes to emitting intercepted or even custom elements to the final output, the following
reference, as provided by the interpreter, allows for much flexibility:

```java
public interface OutputBuilder<B, C> {

  void onBreak();

  void onNonTerminalBegin(MarkupNode nonTerminal);

  @Nullable B onNonTerminalEnd();

  void onText(TextNode node, @Nullable Consumer<B> creationHandler, boolean doNotBuffer);

  void onUnit(UnitNode node, @Nullable Consumer<B> creationHandler);

  void onComponent(C component, StyledNode containingNode);

  List<C> build();

}
```
