# Extension API

This system has been designed with flexibility as well as extensibility in mind from the very get-go. On this
page, the available API usable to define tags and thus AST-nodes as well as to intercept interpretation at
runtime will be documented. Let's look at an abstract overview-diagram regarding the flow of data first:

<img className='rendered-image' style={{width: '100%'}} src={useBaseUrl('/img/overview_diagram.svg')} />

## Defining Tags

While a tag-definition may look deceptively simple at first glance, the possibilities it brings to the table
cannot be overstated.

```java
public abstract class TagDefinition {

  public final TagClosing tagClosing;
  public final TagPriority tagPriority;

  protected TagDefinition(TagClosing tagClosing, TagPriority tagPriority) {
    this.tagClosing = tagClosing;
    this.tagPriority = tagPriority;
  }

  public abstract boolean matchName(String tagNameLower);

  public abstract @NotNull MarkupNode createNode(
    @NotNull String tagNameLower,
    @NotNull CursorPosition position,
    @NotNull AttributeMap attributes,
    @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings,
    @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children
  );
}
```

The above represents the template provided in order to define a new tag, to be registered
in and used with an instance of the `TagRegistry`. Immediately within the `super`-constructor,
the tag closing-type

```java
public enum TagClosing {
  // <my-tag>Content</>
  OPEN_CLOSE,
  // <my-tag/>
  SELF_CLOSE
}
```

is to be defined, where self-closing tags may not bear any content and thereby will always
receive a `children`-list of `null`; next up, a tag-priority

```java
public enum TagPriority {
  // v- Picked first
  HIGHEST,
  HIGH,
  // v- Baseline
  NORMAL,
  LOW,
  LOWEST,
  // ^- Picked last
}

```

will signal which definition to pick if a tag's name matched on multiple registered definitions,
allowing the user to override built-in behavior (although not necessarily recommended) to any
granularity. These already are the only properties required upfront, where name- and attribute-
matching remain completely dynamic.

## Matching Names

Due to the fact that names are not to be specified ahead of time, a tag-definition may handle
patterns of arbitrary complexity, as is the case with [Color Shorthands](./built_in/style.mdx#color-shorthands). Also, in general, tag- as well as attribute-names are case-insensitive.
Once `matchName` returned `true` for one such given name, the tag-definition becomes a candidate
within the list of possible handlers, from which the one of highest priority will prevail.

## Creating Nodes

As soon as the system completed parsing the a tag in its entirety, including attributes as
well as possibly some content, `createNode` will be invoked (with the very same name matched
upon earlier, for reference), whose responsibility it is to instantiate an AST-node,
being a derivative of a `MarkupNode`:

```java
public abstract class MarkupNode {

  public @Nullable ExpressionNode ifCondition;
  public @Nullable ExpressionNode useCondition;

  public CursorPosition position;

  public @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children;
  public @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings;

  public MarkupNode(
    CursorPosition position,
    @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children,
    @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings
  ) {
    this.position = position;
    this.children = children;
    this.letBindings = letBindings;
  }
}
```

The base class already takes care of holding the `position`, as well as optional lists of `children` and
`letBindings` (see [Let-Bindings](./tag_syntax.mdx#let-bindings)). This immediately implies that tags may
implicitly define bindings or modify child-entries. While there are many pre-defined node-types available,
users may also always define their own, handled via [Interpreter-Interception](#interpreter-interception).

## Retrieving Attributes

The astute reader might have noticed that up until this point, no attributes have ever been defined
anywhere - and for good reason: keeping a single source of truth, paired with flexibility. The `AttributeMap`,
as passed into `createNode`, handles access in a somewhat unusual, yet beautifully simplistic manner; let's
take a look at its API first:

```java
public interface AttributeMap {

  // v- Attributes of type expression

  @NotNull ExpressionNode getMandatoryExpressionNode(String name);

  @Nullable ExpressionNode getOptionalExpressionNode(String name);

  @NotNull ExpressionList getMandatoryExpressionList(String name);

  @NotNull ExpressionList getOptionalExpressionList(String name);

  // v- Attributes of type markup

  @NotNull MarkupNode getMandatoryMarkupNode(String name);

  @Nullable MarkupNode getOptionalMarkupNode(String name);

  @NotNull MarkupList getMandatoryMarkupList(String name);

  @NotNull MarkupList getOptionalMarkupList(String name);

}
```

There are two different types of attributes - [Expressions](./expression_syntax.md) as well as a sub-tree of
[Markup](./tag_syntax.mdx), both bound to an identifying `name`, where a name can only ever depict one and the
same type used as an internal representation of the data associated with it. Optional attributes are not required
to be present in order for the construction of the corresponding tag to succeed, while their mandatory
counterparts certainly are, failing parsing if absent; single values (nodes) may be null if omitted, while lists
are always non-null, for convenience. When requiring an attribute as a list, this simply means that it may be
specified more than once, and could possibly be bound using the spread-operator `...`.

The above instantly implies the possibility of dynamic attributes like:
`Y exists and is mandatory if and only if X is present`, as follows:

```java
ExpressionNode xValue = attributes.getOptionalExpressionNode("x");

if (xValue != null) {
  ExpressionNode yValue = attributes.getMandatoryExpressionNode("y");
  // TODO: Handle case 2
}

else {
  // TODO: Handle case 1
}
```

After `constructNode` responded with a result, the `AttributeMap` is internally checked for any unused
attributes and, if any, will fail parsing, telling the user that they've specified unsupported (at
least in their current attribute-constellation) names. This way, a tag can access attributes of exact
types and names as desired, not having to take the burden of validation, without compromising on clarity
when it comes to user-facing error-screens.

Lists of attributes are intentionally represented as an internal wrapper, due to the fact that they may be
dynamically bound, using the spread-operator `...`, which entails that the elements may not be known at
parse-time; such a list is supposed to be stored inside the constructed node as-is, to be evaluated later
during interpretation, using the concept of [Interpreter-Interception](#interpreter-interception); they are
accessed by providing a reference to the interpreter, as follows:

```java
public interface MarkupList {

  boolean isEmpty();

  List<MarkupNode> get(Interpreter interpreter);

}
```

and

```java
public interface ExpressionList {

  boolean isEmpty();

  List<ExpressionNode> get(Interpreter interpreter);

}
```

## Interpreter Interception

Many features require interception at the time of interpretation in order to be implemented; in fact, that's
exactly how - for example - the [Rainbow-Tag](./built_in/rainbow.mdx) operates, by cancelling default processing
of the elements it targets, while emitting its own colorized members into the final output.

### Interception Lifecycle

Registering to be called for interception is again as simple as it gets: once the node as constructed by
`constructNode` implements the following interface, it will be called when it itself is encountered, as well
as for every of its children:

```java
public interface InterpreterInterceptor {

  InterceptionResult interceptInterpretation(MarkupNode node, Interpreter interpreter);

  void afterInterpretation(MarkupNode node, Interpreter interpreter);

  void onSkippedByChild(MarkupNode node, Interpreter interpreter, InterceptionResult priorResult);

}
```

The main point of control, `interceptInterpretation`, may result in one of the following signals:

```java
public enum InterceptionResult {
  DO_NOT_PROCESS,
  DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER,
  DO_PROCESS
}
```

When instructing the interpreter to not process the current node, it will be skipped over in its entirety -
including whichever children it may have contained. In order to only render said members partially, make use
of the provided reference to the interpreter as to emit nodes manually; in most cases, processing will only
be inhibited for terminal nodes though, which are then overridden by custom instances, emitted once again
manually, while `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER` makes for a perfect way to keep a `ThreadLocal` stack within the
AST-node itself, handling state of the feature which leverages interception.

Let's look at an example of concurrent interceptors; even though per tag and thus per node, only at most a
single interceptor may be registered at a time, there may be multiple interceptors in charge at any given
depth. Due to this naturally arising mechanism, interceptors are kept on a stack, from which they are popped
as soon as the scope of their corresponding tag ends; also, interceptors who registered first (outermost tags)
always take precedence by being invoked first. A parent may skip a child's possibility of interception, such
that it is not even called into; also, a child may skip a node which a parent did allow to process:

```component-markup
<a> <!-- begin scope A -->
  <b> <!-- begin scope B -->
    <c> <!-- begin scope C -->
      ...
    </c> <!-- end scope C -->
  </b> <!-- end scope B -->
</a> <!-- end scope A -->
```

- `l-cm: <a>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Registers interceptor `A`
- `l-cm: <b>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls interceptor `B`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Registers interceptor `B`
- `l-cm: <c>`:
  - Calls interceptor `A`: `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls interceptor `B`: `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER`
  - Calls interceptor `C`: `DO_NOT_PROCESS`
  - Calls `onSkippedByChild` of `A` with `DO_PROCESS`
  - Calls `onSkippedByChild` of `B` with `DO_PROCESS_AND_CALL_AFTER`
  - Does not register `C` (as it skipped itself)

### Interpreter Reference

With the lifecycle as described above in mind, an interceptor is now fully enabled to interpret expressions,
introduce temporary variables, interpret markup subtrees, construct platform-specific components and emit to
the output, all thanks to the provided interpreter-reference:

```java
public interface Interpreter {

  TemporaryMemberEnvironment getEnvironment();

  @NotNull String evaluateAsString(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable String evaluateAsStringOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  long evaluateAsLong(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Long evaluateAsLongOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  double evaluateAsDouble(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Double evaluateAsDoubleOrNull(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  boolean evaluateAsBoolean(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  TriState evaluateAsTriState(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  @Nullable Object evaluateAsPlainObject(@Nullable ExpressionNode expression);

  ComponentOutput interpretSubtree(MarkupNode node, SlotContext slotContext);

  OutputBuilder getCurrentBuilder();

  ComponentConstructor getComponentConstructor();

  boolean isInSubtree();

}
```

### Temporary Variables

In order to introduce temporary variables, update- and remove them again, there's an environment-accessor
within the interpreter, providing a way to modify the temporary-variable-stack:

```java
public interface TemporaryMemberEnvironment extends InterpretationEnvironment {

  void pushVariable(String name, Object value);

  void updateVariable(String name, Object value);

  void popVariable(String name);
}
```

### Creating/Modifying Components

Components, as created by invoking the `OutputBuilder` with AST-nodes, may be modified to any degree using the
platform-specific `ComponentConstructor`; next to modifying existing components, custom components may also be
constructed from the ground up using nothing but their parameters, to be emitted directly later on. Learn more
about this class over at the [Platform-API](./platform_api.mdx).

### Emitting To Output

When it comes to emitting intercepted or even custom elements to the final output, the following
reference, as provided by the interpreter, allows for much flexibility:

```java
public interface OutputBuilder {

  void onBreak(BreakNode node);

  void onNonTerminalBegin(MarkupNode nonTerminal);

  @Nullable Object onNonTerminalEnd();

  void onText(TextNode node, @Nullable Consumer<Object> creationHandler, boolean doNotBuffer);

  Object onUnit(UnitNode node);

  void emitComponent(Object component);

}
```

## Deferred Content

:::info
Deferred content is still not entirely nailed down and thus considered experimental.
:::

The concept of deferred components represents another stage of templating: tayloring content
to the specific recipient it's sent to. If this information is already available at the time
of interpretation, the recipient may be passed to the call of the interpreter, causing deferred
components to render immediately, as they now have access to the recipient-reference; otherwise,
the result will contain one or more instances of a custom derivative of the platform's native
component which essentially contains a context-closure that calls back into the deferred node
once said reference is provided later on, right before sending/applying the component.

This concept solves the entire headache of server-side rendered (SSR) components, which simplifies
platform-implementations by a great deal without having to compromise on available features;
quite the opposite - we may introduce whichever SSR-tags and features that prove beneficial
in a version-agnostic manner. Usually, these include: NBT-data, selectors, score-values and
the like.

### Advantages

The main advantage deferred content has over simply employing environment-variables to interpret
ASTs on a per-recipient basis is that this way, non-tailored components are constructed only once,
instead of over and over again, yielding the exact same result each time; think of it as a partially
cached tree. To ensure further efficiency, the paths to deferred components within the result are
stored on a type of prefix-tree, avoiding to needlessly walk all children; once deferred components
are invoked, their result is spliced into the final output by cloning along the necessary paths, leaving
the immutable template untouched.

### The Deferred Node

How does a tag register itself as being deferred? It simply emits a partial tree which either is- or
contains a deferred node, where such a node has to be able to create a parameter to be stored within
the closure, as well as to render the deferred placeholder as concrete and tailored components.

```java
public abstract class DeferredNode<Parameter extends RendererParameter> extends UnitNode implements DeferredRenderer<Parameter> {

  public DeferredNode(CursorPosition position, @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings) {
    super(position, letBindings);
  }

  public abstract Parameter createParameter(Interpreter interpreter);

}
```

While the parameter may be of whatever desired type, it is considered good practise to implement a proper
plain-text representation which is substituted whenever raw (non-substituted) results are applied/sent such
that the API-user knows that they forgot to pass a receiver-reference before applying said result;
this may also be rather handy when debugging one's template and while developing the system in general.

```java
public interface RendererParameter {

  String asPlainText();

}
```

The deferred renderer receives the parameter constructed prior, a reference to the component-constructor, the
context of the slot which it is rendered into, as to simply pass on to the interpreter (if required) to ensure
proper reset-behavior, as well as a snapshot of the environment containing the state at the point in time of the
corresponding tag within the cycle of interpretation. All of this information allows for seamless integration.

```java
public interface DeferredRenderer<Parameter extends RendererParameter> {

  /**
   * @return A list of components, where (if supported by the slot) each represents
   *         another line; return null to become invisible (no content).
   */
  @Nullable List<Object> renderComponent(
    Parameter parameter,
    ComponentConstructor componentConstructor,
    InterpretationEnvironment environment,
    SlotContext slotContext,
    @Nullable Object recipient
  );
}
```

### Example

Let's implement a very simple tag called `l-me: <player-name/>`, starting out by defining a parameter
which just captures whether to use the display-name or the plain account-name.

```java
public class PlayerNameParameter implements RendererParameter {

  public boolean displayName;

  public PlayerNameParameter(boolean displayName) {
    this.displayName = displayName;
  }

  @Override
  public String asPlainText() {
    return "PlayerName{displayName=" + displayName + "}";
  }
}
```

Next up, by deriving the `DeferredNode`, we prepare for defining the corresponding tag - its attributes
will feed into the constructor of this class, allowing for not only the aforementioned display-name
flag, but also to provide a custom markup-representation.

```java
public class PlayerNameNode extends DeferredNode<PlayerNameParameter> {

  public final @Nullable ExpressionNode displayName;
  public final @Nullable MarkupNode representation;

  public PlayerNameNode(
    @Nullable ExpressionNode displayName,
    @Nullable MarkupNode representation,
    CursorPosition position,
    @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings
  ) {
    super(position, letBindings);

    this.displayName = displayName;
    this.representation = representation;
  }

  @Override
  public @Nullable List<Object> renderComponent(
    PlayerNameParameter parameter,
    ComponentConstructor componentConstructor,
    InterpretationEnvironment environment,
    SlotContext slotContext,
    @Nullable Object recipient
  ) {
    if (recipient == null)
      return null;

    DeferredDataProvider provider = componentConstructor.getDataProvider();
    String name = parameter.displayName ? provider.getDisplayName(recipient) : provider.getName(recipient);

    if (representation == null)
      return Collections.singletonList(componentConstructor.createTextComponent(name));

    // v- Do not modify the component of the closure, as it may be reused!
    environment = environment.copy().withVariable("player_name", name);

    //    Deferred content allows for fully fledged markup!
    //    By passing the recipient directly to the interpreter, deeply nested deferred tags
    //    will render immediately, assuring that the unprocessed components will not contain
    //    any more closures - because all information is available right now anyways. This
    // v- allows for a great deal of reusable and context-insensitive templating.
    return MarkupInterpreter.interpret(
      componentConstructor, environment, recipient, slotContext, representation
    ).unprocessedComponents;
  }

  @Override
  public PlayerNameParameter createParameter(Interpreter interpreter) {
    return new PlayerNameParameter(interpreter.evaluateAsBoolean(this.displayName));
  }
}
```

Last but not least, the tag can be defined, which now constructs the node above, thereby
registering deferred content.

```java
public class PlayerNameTag extends TagDefinition {

  public PlayerNameTag() {
    super(TagClosing.SELF_CLOSE, TagPriority.NORMAL);
  }

  @Override
  public boolean matchName(String tagNameLower) {
    return tagNameLower.equals("player-name");
  }

  @Override
  public @NotNull MarkupNode createNode(
    @NotNull String tagNameLower,
    @NotNull CursorPosition position,
    @NotNull AttributeMap attributes,
    @Nullable List<LetBinding> letBindings,
    @Nullable List<MarkupNode> children
  ) {
    return new PlayerNameNode(
      attributes.getOptionalExpressionNode("display-name"),
      attributes.getOptionalMarkupNode("representation"),
      position, letBindings
    );
  }
}
```

When rendering the tag, it works as expected - especially with monochrome color.

```component-markup
<gray>Hello, <aqua><player-name/></>! :)
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/deferred_example_monochrome.png')} />

If gradients or rainbows are to be applied, they will not be able to take effect as expected,
since the deferred node is represented by a single component at the time of interpretation,
which does not yet know the content and thus its length - making it be an atomic unit.

```component-markup
<gray>Hello, <rainbow><player-name/></>! :)
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/deferred_example_rainbow_outer.png')} />

For this exact reason, the representation allows to interpret custom markup at the time of
substituting deferred content - now, rainbows apply properly. This style of implementation
allows for much flexibility, like to provide custom representations for retrieved data. As
can be seen in the implementation of the corresponding node above, the variable `player_name`
is introduced, containing the resolved value to be visualised however desired.

```component-markup
<gray>Hello, <player-name representation={ <rainbow>{player_name} } />! :)
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/deferred_example_rainbow_inner.png')} />

The environment (which includes all temporary variables) is captured at the
point in time during interpretation at which the corresponding deferred tag resides, which is
also passed down into the render-method - thus, "outer" variables are easily accessible. This
combination allows for flexible and uniform markup across multiple stages of evaluation.

```component-markup
<gray let-my_var="'test'">Hello,<space/>
  <player-name
    representation={ <rainbow>{player_name}</>, <red>{my_var} }
  />! :)
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/deferred_example_environment_snapshot.png')} />
