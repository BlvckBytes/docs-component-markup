# Defer

## Overview

This tag itself does not add any contents or styles, nor does it affect appearance - it simply marks its value to be rendered in a deferred manner, meaning that it will be wrapped in a closure-component and emitted to the output, such that it can later be evaluated when needed.

By doing so, one can avoid having to re-interpret the whole markup only because parts of it are changing over time. As of now, this tag is mostly a tool for developers, such that they can enable the aforementioned re-use optimisation as well as to explore the system and its possibilities.


<TagDocRender tag={{
  name: 'defer',
  aliases: [],
  selfClosing: true,
  attributes: [
    {
      name: 'value',
      aliases: [],
      description: 'Markup to be rendered in a deferred manner',
      fallback: null,
      multiValue: false,
      type: AttributeType.MARKUP,
    }
  ]
}} />

## Examples

### Live Date

In the following example, the rainbow does not have to be re-interpreted or re-generated and remains cached, while the date is deferred and thus interpreted and generated for each update.

```component-markup
<rainbow>The current time is: <&b><deferred content={<date format="HH:mm:ss"/>}/>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/defered_live_date.gif')} />
