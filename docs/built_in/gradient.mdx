# Gradient

Colorizes enclosed content with one continuous gradient char-by-char, where client-rendered content
like the [Keybind](./keybind.md)-Tag and its companions cannot, due to inherent limitations, be
split up and will just be considered as an atomic unit. Check out the examples regarding common attributes
over at the [Rainbow](./rainbow.mdx)-Tag, as they behave exactly the same and their documentation is
therefore kept centrally.

| Attribute           | Type         | Mandatory | Default         | Description                                       |
|:-------------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| color               | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: null`    | Colors to be used within the gradient             |
| offset              | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: null`    | Offsets at which the colors lie; 0-100%           |
| z-index             | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: 0`       | Z-indices of the color-points                     |
| override-colors     | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to override already colorized members     |
| skip-whitespace     | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: true`    | Whether to skip whitespace when coloring          |
| skip-non-text       | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to skip atomic units like `l-cm: <key/>`  |
| merge-inner         | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to merge inner gradients for continuity   |
| deep                | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to dive into children's markup-attributes |
| phase               | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: 0.0`     | Phase-offset of the transition; 0-100%            |

When specifying `color`-points on the gradient, simply specify them one each per attribute

```component-markup
<gradient
  color="red"
  color="blue"
  color="green"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

or employ the spread-operator in order to bind a dynamic list of items

```component-markup
<gradient
  [...color]="['red', 'blue', 'green']"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

When not specifying any `offset`-values, colors will simply be spaced equidistant automatically. When specifying
less offsets than colors, the provided entries are sorted ascendingly and clamped to an interval between 0 and 100;
the remaining distance, if any, will be shared equidistant amongst the remaining colors. Usually though, one either
specifies no offsets, or all of them, for fine-grained control. For manually specified gradients, it is recommended
to specify `color`- and `offset`-values in an alternating manner to increase readability.

```component-markup
<gradient
  color="red"
  offset=0
  color="blue"
  offset=25.2
  color="green"
  offset=70.5
  color="gold"
  offset=100
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

When specifying dynamic templates with full control, simply mark both attributes by the spread-operator and
pass one list each using the environment.

```component-markup
<gradient
  [...color]="my_colors"
  [...offset]="my_offsets"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

When it comes to z-indices, they too are assigned one-by-one to colors, meaning that if one wants to specify
the third index, the prior two values need to be specified also, in order to avoid being erroneously assigned
to the first. In general, it is advised to always specify the used attribute at hand for all color-points or
for none, as to avoid confusion.

## Examples

### Two Color Gradient

The simplest form of a gradient is that between two colors.

```component-markup
<gradient
  color="red"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/two_color_gradient.png')} />

### Three Color Gradient

By adding another color, the offsets along the gradient will be automatically balanced if not specified otherwise.

```component-markup
<gradient
  color="red"
  color="yellow"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/three_color_gradient.png')} />

### Variable Phase Gradient

By binding the phase-offset to an environment-variable, all while altering said variable in-between calls to
render, animations may be created.

```component-markup
<gradient
  [phase]="current_phase"
  color="red"
  color="yellow"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/variable_phase_gradient.gif')} />

### Variable Offset Gradient

If instead of shifting the whole gradient, just a single point (or multiple points, for that matter) on it is to be
moved, simply bind the corresponding offset(s) to altering environment-variables. It is highly advised to now
also employ the `z-index` attribute as to ensure that the moving point(s) take precedence all along the gradient
in order to avoid visual glitches.

```component-markup
<gradient
  color="red"
  offset=0
  z-index=0
  color="yellow"
  [offset]="current_phase"
  z-index=1
  color="blue"
  offset=100
  z-index=0
>All of the fancy gradient colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/variable_offset_gradient.gif')} />
