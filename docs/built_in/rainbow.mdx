# Rainbow

Colorizes enclosed content with one continuous rainbow char-by-char, where client-rendered content
like the [Keybind](./keybind.md)-Tag and its companions cannot, due to inherent limitations, be
split up and will just be considered as an atomic unit.

| Attribute           | Type   | Mandatory | Default         | Description                                       |
|:-------------------:|:------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| override-colors     | Scalar | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to override already colorized members     |
| skip-whitespace     | Scalar | no        | `l-me: true`    | Whether to skip whitespace when coloring          |
| skip-non-text       | Scalar | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to skip atomic units like `l-cm: <key/>`  |
| merge-inner         | Scalar | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to merge inner rainbows for continuity    |
| deep                | Scalar | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to dive into children's markup-attributes |
| phase               | Scalar | no        | `l-me: 0.0`     | Phase-offset of the transition; 0-100%            |

## Examples

### Continuous Rainbow

The simplest form of a rainbow, using all standard attribute-values.

```component-markup
<rainbow>All of the fancy rainbow colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/static_continuous_rainbow.png')} />


### Injected Color

By default, colorized members will keep their style and the transition will just skip over them.

```component-markup
<rainbow>All of the <red>fancy</> rainbow colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/static_injected_rainbow.png')} />

### Split Individual Rainbows

In the following example, the text `l-me: 'hellohello-worldworld-testtest'` is to be colorized
with individual rainbows per word, having the hyphens shaded in a mere grey-tone.

```component-markup
<rainbow
  *for-word="'hellohello-worldworld-testtest' @ '-'"
  for-separator={<gray>-}
>{{word}}</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/static_split_rainbow.png')} />

The above could also be specified without making use of advanced features like loops and the
explode-operator, just like the following example portrays:

```component-markup
<rainbow>hellohello</><gray>-</><rainbow>worldworld</><gray>-</><rainbow>testtest</>
```

But the prior style allows for great flexibility when it comes to data-driven rendering, as injected monochrome
passages may now be dynamically defined by the environment.

### Split Continuous Rainbow

When the merge-attribute is enabled, inner rainbows will be joined in order to allow for visual continuity.

```component-markup
<rainbow merge-inner=true>
  <rainbow
    *for-word="'hellohello-worldworld-testtest' @ '-'"
    for-separator={<gray>-}
  >{{word}}</>
</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/static_split_continuous_rainbow.png')} />

### Animated Split Continuous Rainbow

By binding the phase-offset to an environment-variable, all while altering said variable in-between calls to
render, animations may be created.

```component-markup
<rainbow
  merge-inner=true
  [phase]="current_phase"
>
  <rainbow
    *for-word="'hellohello-worldworld-testtest' @ '-'"
    for-separator={<gray>-}
  >{{word}}</>
</>
```


<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/animated_split_continuous_rainbow.gif')} />
