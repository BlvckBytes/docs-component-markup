# Transition

Colorizes enclosed content with a monochome color based on the current phase of the gradient; this tag is similar
to the [Gradient](./gradient.mdx)-Tag, just that the gradient does not occur on a char-by-char basis, but instead
on a whole-content basis. This feature usually makes the most sense not necessarily in chat, but at in-place updatable
slots like the action-bar, tab, scoreboard, etc. Check out the details regarding these attributes over at the
aforementioned Gradient-Tag, as they behave exactly the same and their documentation is therefore kept centrally.

| Attribute           | Type         | Mandatory | Default         | Description                                       |
|:-------------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| color               | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: null`    | Colors to be used within the gradient             |
| offset              | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: null`    | Offsets at which the colors lie; 0-100%           |
| z-index             | Multi-Scalar | no        | `l-me: 0`       | Z-indices of the color-points                     |
| override-colors     | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to override already colorized members     |
| skip-non-text       | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to skip atomic units like `l-cm: <key/>`  |
| deep                | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: false`   | Whether to dive into children's markup-attributes |
| phase               | Scalar       | no        | `l-me: 0.0`     | Phase-offset of the transition; 0-100%            |

## Examples

### Two Color Transition

The simplest form of a transition is that between two colors.

```component-markup
<transition
  [phase]="current_phase"
  color="red"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy transition colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/two_color_transition.png')} />

### Three Color Transition

By adding another color, the offsets along the transition will be automatically balanced if not specified otherwise.

```component-markup
<transition
  [phase]="current_phase"
  color="red"
  color="green"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy transition colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/three_color_transition.png')} />

### Injected Static Color

If not specified otherwise, existing colors won't be overridden, allowing the user to set
certain statically tinted highlights.

```component-markup
<transition
  [phase]="current_phase"
  color="red"
  color="blue"
>All of the fancy <gold>transition</> colors!</>
```

<img className='rendered-image' src={useBaseUrl('/img/injected_static_transition.png')} />
