# Consumer API

The consumer-facing API has been kept as concise and convenient as humanly possible, in order to be easily
integrateable into whichever approach to managing configuration-files as well as various other day-to-day
surroundings the developer at hand may have chosen.

## Parsing the AST

In order to parse an input-string into an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree),
the only parameter required is a reference to the tag-registry being used; in the majority of cases, the
built-in instance will suffice, allowing for quick and easy access:

```java
try {
  MarkupNode ast = MarkupParser.parse(InputView.of("<rainbow>Hello, world!"), BuiltInTagRegistry.INSTANCE);
} catch (MarkupParseException parseException) {
  for (String line : parseException.makeErrorScreen())
    LoggerProvider.log(Level.SEVERE, line);
}
```

In general, errors are only thrown during the parsing-stage, with all errors being unified under the
`MarkupParseException`, which is also able to generate a nicely formatted error-screen, for example:

```
1: <translate
2:   *let-a="b"
3:   [key]="my.expr[222 c.d.e"
----------------------^
Error: Expected a closing-bracket after the indexing-invocation: ]
4:   fallback={
5:     hello, {user}
6:   }
7: />
```

Next to the above, there are also many dozens of error-type enumeration-constants all throughout the system,
stemming from stages like the CML event-parser as well as the expression tokenizer/parser; these are subject
to change and not considered stable API, which is why next to this mention, they will not be documented.

## Interpreting the AST

Once an input has been successfully parsed, its result as well as all calls to the interpreter are now safe - they
will never throw at runtime and instead simply log errors to the console, which are handled as gracefully as
possible, as to not bring down whatever relied on receiving an output to render.

```java
// Platform-specific reference obtained via the factory
// TODO: An implementation of said factory still requires more work
ComponentConstructor componentConstructor;
DataProvider dataProvider;

// An instance which has been successfully parsed prior
MarkupNode ast;

InterpretationEnvironment myEnvironment = new InterpretationEnvironment()
  .withVariable("first_variable", "hello, world!")
  .withVariable("second_variable", Math.random());

// TODO: In the future, slot-type decision as well as application will
//       be handled by a more convenient helper

List<Object> components = MarkupInterpreter.interpret(
  componentConstructor,
  dataProvider,
  myEnvironment,
  null, // No recipient that tags may custom-tailor for
  SlotType.CHAT,
  ast
);

// The components above may now be manually applied however necessary
```

## Logging Errors

Since runtime-errors are handled gracefully, logging is an integral part of this system; thus, the internally
widely-used `LoggerProvider` has been introduced, which allows the user to provide a reference of their own
at any point in time:

```java
public class LoggerProvider {

  private static Logger logger = Logger.getAnonymousLogger();

  public static void log(Level level, String message, Throwable throwable) {
    logger.log(level, message, throwable);
  }

  public static void log(Level level, String message, boolean printStackTrace) {
    logger.log(level, message);

    if (!printStackTrace)
      return;

    for (StackTraceElement stackTraceElement : Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace())
      logger.log(level, "    at " + stackTraceElement);
  }

  public static void log(Level level, String message) {
    log(level, message, true);
  }

  public static void set(Logger logger) {
    LoggerProvider.logger = logger;
  }
}
```
